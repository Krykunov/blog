# Blog Code Repository

This repository contains the complete code examples and projects from my blog posts. Each blog post has its own folder with a fully functional project that you can run locally.

## Projects

### [spotify-widget](./spotify-widget/)
**Blog Post**: "Building a Production-Ready Spotify 'Now Playing' Widget with Next.js"

A complete Next.js application that displays your currently playing Spotify track with:
- Real-time updates
- Server-side caching
- Comprehensive error handling
- Beautiful responsive UI
- TypeScript implementation

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains its own README with setup instructions. Generally:

1. Navigate to the project folder
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see project README)
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
